      <p>
        I'm a junior in <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/">EECS</a>
        at MIT (Course 6-2), a tech enthusiast, and an optimist with a passion for learning.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I'm working on personal projects, leading the Logistics team for HackMIT,
        perfecting my Linux setup, serving as president of my dorm, or becoming a power i3wm and Vim user.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        I love being outdoors whenever I can find time &mdash; whether that means skiing,
        mountain biking, and hiking whenever I can, exploring whatever area I'm living in,
        or just finding a spot outside to sit down with a good book.

          <h3>SteetSmarts</h3>
          <p>
            Originally conceived as the final project for
            <a href="http://catalog.mit.edu/search/?P=6.08">6.08</a>,
            the StreetSmarts system is capable of fully facilitating communication between
            street lamps across the city, emergency providers, and a web interface.
            <br><br>
            In an emergency situation, first responders are immediately notified
            of the location and quickest route via the responder module. Within a
            few seconds street lamps along that route begin to flash red, signaling
            drivers to move aside and providing visual directions to the first
            responders, removing the need for slow GPS or perfect knowledge of
            the city.

          <h3>Blueprint 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Blueprint is a weekend-long learnathon and hackathon for local high school
            students held at MIT's campus. It gives them the opportunity to learn from
            MIT students, make new friends, and build something cool! Blueprint is
            organized by HackMIT, the same group that runs MIT's largest hackathon.

            As part of the HackMIT Dev and Logistics team, I contributed significantly
            to the development of the Blueprint 2019 website and to the event itself.

          <h3>Rhythm Badge Project</h3>
          <p>
            During the 2018 summer, I worked in the Human Dynamics group at the MIT
            Media Lab on a project called Rhythm Badges. We ran a study on around 80
            participants, collecting data on their location and communication during
            their time at the Delta V accelerator, part of MIT's Martin Trust Center.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            As an undergraduate research assistant, it was my responsiblity to
            analyze the daily data for compliance, combine it daily survey data,
            and determine the appropriate reward for each participant. Additionally,
            I developed a processing pipeline that turned the raw JSON files into
            easily analyzable dataframes, and stored them in a highly compressed,
            efficient format.

          <h3>Shoppy</h3>
          <p>
            Bringing the digital revolution to brick and mortar stores &mdash;
            Shoppy leverages Apple's ARKit to allow the busy urban shopper to
            simply point their phone at an item, place it in the basket, and leave.
            See a demo of the mobile app <a href="https://youtu.be/3dNDd8Z8pkY">here.</a>
            <br><br>Additionally, Shoppy leverages bluetooth beacons in-store to provide
            real-time analytics to stores, at a finer grain than ever before was possible.
            Learn exactly where and when customers add to basket, when they put things back,
            or even show customers customized location-aware in-store promotions. Learn more
