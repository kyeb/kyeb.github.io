          I'm a senior in <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/">EECS</a>
          at MIT (Course 6-2), a tech enthusiast, and an optimist with a passion
          for learning.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Recently, I've been working on
          <a href="https://politi.chat">Politichat</a>, optimizing
          <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>'s' dashboard performance, and
          a new management app for my dorm's front desk (packages and check-in).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Previously, I lead the Logistics team for
          <a href="https://hackmit.org">HackMIT</a>, served as treasurer, then
          president, then WebTech chair of
          <a href="https://maseeh.mit.edu/">Maseeh Hall</a>, MIT's largest dorm,
          interned at Microsoft, and worked as an undergrad researcher at the
          MIT Media Lab.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I love being outdoors whenever I can find time &mdash; whether that
          means skiing, mountain biking, and hiking whenever I can, exploring
          whatever area I'm living in, or just finding a spot outside to sit
          down with a good book.
        </p>
        <br />

          I keep meaning to start a blog, but still haven't gotten around to it.
          One day, more interesting content will live here.

            <p>
              Politichat is a queue-style video chat platform where constituents
              can virtually line up to speak with a candidate, allowing
              candidates to have personal, virtual conversations that support
              their campaigns. We fill the technology gap between large,
              impersonal livestreamed virtual rallies and low-throughput,
              high-impact individual conversations.

              As head of Logistics for HackMIT 2019, I've poured my life and
              soul into making this event - MIT's largest hackathon - the best
              it can possibly be.

              Originally conceived as the final project for
              <a href="http://catalog.mit.edu/search/?P=6.08">6.08</a>, the
              StreetSmarts system is capable of fully facilitating communication
              between street lamps across the city, emergency providers, and a
              web interface. <br />
              <br />
              In an emergency situation, first responders are immediately
              notified of the location and quickest route via the responder
              module. Within a few seconds street lamps along that route begin
              to flash red, signaling drivers to move aside and providing visual
              directions to the first responders, removing the need for slow GPS
              or perfect knowledge of the city.

            <h3>Blueprint 2019</h3>
            <p>
              Blueprint is a weekend-long learnathon and hackathon for local
              high school students held at MIT's campus. It gives them the
              opportunity to learn from MIT students, make new friends, and
              build something cool! Blueprint is organized by HackMIT, the same
              group that runs MIT's largest hackathon.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As part of the HackMIT Dev and Logistics team, I contributed
              significantly to the development of the Blueprint 2019 website and
              to the event itself.

            <p>
              During the 2018 summer, I worked in the Human Dynamics group at
              the MIT Media Lab on a project called Rhythm Badges. We ran a
              study on around 80 participants, collecting data on their location
              and communication during their time at the Delta V accelerator,
              part of MIT's Martin Trust Center.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As an undergraduate research assistant, it was my responsiblity to
              analyze the daily data for compliance, combine it daily survey
              data, and determine the appropriate reward for each participant.
              Additionally, I developed a processing pipeline that turned the
              raw JSON files into easily analyzable dataframes, and stored them
              in a highly compressed, efficient format.

              Bringing the digital revolution to brick and mortar stores &mdash;
              Shoppy leverages Apple's ARKit to allow the busy urban shopper to
              simply point their phone at an item, place it in the basket, and
              leave. See a demo of the mobile app

              <br />Additionally, Shoppy leverages bluetooth beacons in-store to
              provide real-time analytics to stores, at a finer grain than ever
              before was possible. Learn exactly where and when customers add to
              basket, when they put things back, or even show customers
              customized location-aware in-store promotions. Learn more about
